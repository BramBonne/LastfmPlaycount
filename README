Info
====

The Last.fm playcount synchronization plugin for Rhythmbox fetches the
currently playing track's playcount from Last.fm, and updates your Rhythmbox
database accordingly.
The Last.fm username is read from Rhythmbox' Last.fm plugin.


How to install for the current user (locally)
=============================================

Create the directory ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
    mkdir ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
Copy the files in the current directory to the newly created directory (or extract this archive's contents into that directory)
    cp * ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
    
    
How to install for all users (globally, needs root/sudo rights)
===============================================================

Create the directory /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
    sudo mkdir /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
Copy the files in the current directory to the newly created directory (or extract this archive's contents into that directory)
    sudo cp * /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
    
    
How to enable
=============

After installing the plugin in one of the two ways mentioned above, start up Rhythmbox, and head over to the "Edit > Plugins" menu. Check the box next to "Last.fm playcount synchronization".
Also make sure that you also have the regular "Last.fm" plugin enabled, since your Last.fm credentials stored in this plugin are used by the Last.fm playcount synchronization plugin to get the correct playcounts.
